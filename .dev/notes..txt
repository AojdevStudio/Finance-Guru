/gsd:discuss-phase — phases where plans assumed “vision” decisions

/gsd:discuss-phase 2 (Setup Automation): scripts/automation, minimal UX

Discuss first (highest risk / most UX ambiguity):
- /gsd:discuss-phase 3 (Onboarding Wizard)
  - Why: User-facing interactive CLI
  - Decide: question flow, presentation style, validation behavior, help text, branching vs linear

- /gsd:discuss-phase 8 (Rolling Tracker & Hedge Sizer)
  - Why: Most complex phase (6 plans); CLI design heavy
  - Decide: subcommand naming, output format (status / suggest-roll / history), roll suggestion display

- /gsd:discuss-phase 10 (Template Engine)
  - Why: Visual interactive product
  - Decide: explorer layout, node appearance, interactions (click/hover/drag), color scheme

- /gsd:discuss-phase 11 (Self-Assessment & Topics)
  - Why: Interactive UX choices
  - Decide: 4-state cycling behavior, guided vs standard vs yolo differences, topic content depth

- /gsd:discuss-phase 12 (Maya/CLI/Landing): landing page design + CLI ergonomics (templates exist; builds on 10–11)
- /gsd:discuss-phase 9 (SQQQ vs Puts): mostly presentation (math/formulas fixed by research)
- /gsd:discuss-phase 7 (Total Return): mainly CLI output formatting (narrow scope; follows existing patterns)


Skip (infrastructure; minimal gray areas):
- Phase 1 (Git Scrub): tool-dictated (git-filter-repo, gitleaks)
- 
- Phase 4 (Polish & Hooks): mostly technical (SIGINT, Bun migration)
- Phase 5 (Agent Readiness): needs planning, but scope is lint/templates/coverage (low UX ambiguity)
- Phase 6 (Config & Models): internal infrastructure for downstream CLIs
