    "Okay, I need some suggestions and ideas for things we need to build out.\n\nSo far, we're doing well creating tools for ourselves that our agents can use. We have successfully put together a market data tool, which will be used by agents soon.\n\nWhat other technical analysis tools would be great to write in Python for our agents? I think our quant analysts will probably suggest some things we need to create. ",
    "Okay, can you put that list of what we need into our Notebooks folder? Let's just call it \"Build List,\" because I will have to go through each item and decide if we want to do it or not.\n\nThank you so much for your list."
