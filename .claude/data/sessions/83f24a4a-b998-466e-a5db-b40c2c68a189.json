I understand be safe but the role of this entire finance guru system is to help me generate income for the portfolio.. so we need to be realistic here. Not selling options on a tech stock that has risen so much is also foolish.. we just have to find ways to do it without losing the upside or where the chances of us losing the upside is quite low say 20-35% chance. so that's where your team comes in to crunch the numbers and help me",

    "ok wait you see sometimes you've gotta assume idk what i really want. so for PLTR what i need is insurance since i believe in the stock.. for TSLA what i want is to generate income."
