## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: M1 before M2 is non-negotiable -- hedging tools need user-profile.yaml with stable schema
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 (git scrub) is CRITICAL prerequisite before any public visibility
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (SQQQ comparison) isolated due to highest-risk calculation
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1, 8, 9 flagged for /gsd:research-phase before planning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Exact PII exposure in git history unknown -- needs audit before scrub plan
- [Phase 7]: options_chain scanner (scan_chain) has stderr side effects -- pragmatic vs clean extraction TBD
- [Phase 9]: Cytoscape.js WebGL vs Canvas decision deferred to research
