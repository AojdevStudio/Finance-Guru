<objective>
Restructure setup.sh orchestration flow to fail-fast on dependency failures, streamline directory creation, ensure full idempotency, and produce a clean end-to-end first-time setup experience.

Purpose: Plan 01 added the dependency checker. This plan wires it into a clean orchestration flow: deps check first (exit if fail), then directory creation, then config scaffolding, then clear next-steps guidance. The existing setup.sh has 11 steps with mixed concerns and no fail-fast -- this plan restructures into a logical progression that a new user can follow.

Output: A fully rewritten setup.sh that satisfies all Phase 2 success criteria: works on fresh machine, fails clearly on missing deps, creates correct directory structure, and is idempotent on re-run.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure setup.sh orchestration flow</name>
  <files>setup.sh</files>
  <action>
Rewrite setup.sh into a clean orchestration flow. The dependency checker from Plan 01 stays intact. Everything else gets restructured.

**New setup.sh flow** (5 phases, not 11 steps):

```
Phase 1: Parse CLI arguments (--check-deps-only, --help)
Phase 2: Check dependencies (fail-fast — exit 1 if any missing)
Phase 3: Create directory structure (fin-guru-private/ and subdirs)
Phase 4: Scaffold configuration files (user-profile template, .env, README)
Phase 5: Install Python dependencies (uv sync)
Done: Print next steps
```

**Specific changes:**

1. **Remove the scattered dependency checks** from old Steps 7, 10, 11. All dep checking is now consolidated in check_all_deps (from Plan 01). Remove the old `if command -v uv` and `if command -v bun` blocks that were embedded mid-flow.

2. **Restructure directory creation** (old Steps 1-3) into a single `create_directory_structure()` function:
   - fin-guru-private/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/strategies/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/strategies/active/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/strategies/archive/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/strategies/risk-management/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/tickets/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/analysis/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/analysis/reports/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/reports/
   - fin-guru-private/fin-guru/archive/
   - fin-guru-private/guides/
   - fin-guru/data/ (for user profile)
   - The existing create_dir() helper already handles idempotency (checks if dir exists). Keep it.

3. **Restructure config scaffolding** (old Steps 4-6) into a `scaffold_config_files()` function:
   - Create user-profile.yaml template in fin-guru/data/ (only if not exists — existing logic is correct)
   - Create fin-guru-private/README.md (only if not exists — existing logic is correct)
   - Copy .env from .env.example (only if not exists — existing logic is correct)
   - Each file creation checks existence first = idempotent

4. **Restructure Python dependency installation** into `install_python_deps()` function:
   - Simply runs `uv sync` (we already verified uv exists in Phase 2)
   - No need for the old `if command -v uv` guard since deps check already passed

5. **Remove old Steps 8-11** entirely:
   - Step 8 (symlink commands to ~/.claude/) — Remove. This is not part of Phase 2 scope and creates global side effects. Onboarding wizard (Phase 3) handles this.
   - Step 9 (symlink skills to ~/.claude/) — Remove. Same reason.
   - Step 10 (run onboarding wizard) — Remove. Onboarding is Phase 3. setup.sh should NOT call bun scripts/onboarding/index.ts. Instead, print a "Next steps" message telling user to run onboarding.
   - Step 11 (MCP Launchpad check) — Remove. MCP setup is optional and belongs in onboarding, not setup.

6. **Update the "Next steps" message** at the end:
   - Step 1: Run the onboarding wizard (Phase 3 will create this)
   - Step 2: Configure MCP servers (optional, links to docs)
   - Step 3: Start Finance Guru with /finance-orchestrator
   - Keep the note about yfinance working without API keys

7. **Idempotency guarantee:**
   - Every create_dir call already checks existence
   - Every file creation already checks existence
   - `uv sync` is inherently idempotent (re-running is safe)
   - On second run, user sees "Exists:" messages instead of "Created:" messages
   - No data is overwritten, no prompts for fields that exist (full idempotency at setup.sh level; field-level diffing is Phase 3 onboarding concern)

8. **Important: Do NOT implement these (anti-features / out of scope):**
   - Auto-install of any dependency (M1-X07)
   - Running onboarding wizard (Phase 3)
   - MCP server configuration (Phase 3)
   - Symlink creation to ~/.claude/ (Phase 3)
   - Field-level diffing of config files (ONBD-06 scope is "only prompts for missing fields" which is about the onboarding wizard, not setup.sh. setup.sh idempotency = skip existing files.)

  <name>Task 2: End-to-end verification against Phase 2 success criteria</name>
  <files>setup.sh</files>
  <action>
Run the four Phase 2 success criteria as explicit tests:

**Success Criterion 1:** "Running `./setup.sh` on a machine with prerequisites installed completes without errors and creates the fin-guru-private/ directory structure"
```bash
# Clean slate test: remove fin-guru-private, run setup, verify structure
rm -rf /tmp/setup-test && mkdir /tmp/setup-test
cp setup.sh /tmp/setup-test/
cp .env.example /tmp/setup-test/
mkdir -p /tmp/setup-test/fin-guru
cd /tmp/setup-test
bash setup.sh
test -d fin-guru-private/fin-guru/analysis && echo "PASS: SC1"
cd -
rm -rf /tmp/setup-test
```

**Success Criterion 2:** "Running `./setup.sh` on a machine missing Python 3.12+, uv, or Bun shows the exact install command for each missing dependency and exits with a non-zero code"
```bash
# Test with manipulated PATH to simulate missing deps
(export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin"; bash setup.sh 2>&1; echo "Exit: $?") | tail -20
# Should show install commands and "Exit: 1"
```

**Success Criterion 3:** "Running `./setup.sh --check-deps-only` performs a dry-run dependency check without creating files or starting onboarding"
```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
cp setup.sh "$tmpdir/"
cd "$tmpdir"
bash setup.sh --check-deps-only
count=$(ls -1 | wc -l)
cd -
rm -rf "$tmpdir"
# count should be 1 (only setup.sh)
echo "Files after --check-deps-only: $count (expected: 1)"
```

**Success Criterion 4:** "Running `./setup.sh` a second time detects existing configuration and only prompts for missing fields (idempotent)"
```bash
# Run setup.sh twice, second run should show "Exists:" messages
bash setup.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
bash setup.sh 2>&1 | grep "Exists:" | head -5
echo "PASS: SC4 (idempotent re-run shows Exists messages)"
```

If any criterion fails, fix setup.sh and re-test until all four pass.

Note: Success Criterion 2 test may vary by machine — PATH manipulation approach depends on where python3/uv/bun are installed. The key verification is that the error message includes install commands (grep for "curl" or "python.org" in output).
  </action>
  <verify>
All four Phase 2 success criteria produce PASS:
1. SC1: Fresh setup creates fin-guru-private/ structure
2. SC2: Missing deps shows install commands and exits non-zero
3. SC3: --check-deps-only creates no files
4. SC4: Second run is idempotent
  </verify>
  <done>
  - All four Phase 2 success criteria from ROADMAP.md are verified
  - setup.sh handles both fresh-machine and repeat-run scenarios correctly
  - No regressions in existing fin-guru-private/ structure
  </done>
</task>

Phase-level verification for Plan 02:

1. **ONBD-05 coverage:** setup.sh orchestrates the full first-time setup flow: dependency check -> directory creation -> config scaffold -> dependency install -> next steps.

2. **ONBD-06 coverage:** Re-running setup.sh detects existing directories (via create_dir) and existing files (via `test -f` guards). No data is overwritten. "Exists:" messages confirm detection. Note: field-level diffing within config files is Phase 3 onboarding wizard scope, not setup.sh scope.

3. **SETUP-01 coverage:** Dependency checker verifies Python 3.12+, uv, and Bun. Shows exact install commands on failure. Fails fast with non-zero exit code.

4. **SETUP-02 coverage:** setup.sh creates fin-guru-private/ with all required subdirectories (strategies, analysis, tickets, guides, etc.).

5. **SETUP-03 coverage:** --check-deps-only flag runs dependency check only, exits without creating files.

6. **Anti-feature M1-X07:** No auto-installation. Only check + show install commands.
